The original tarball for this package was repackaged to remove the
files src/hardware/fmopl.c and src/hardware/fmopl.h which are based on
code from the MAME project under a non-free license. The files
src/hardware/ymf262.c and src/hardware/ymf262.h were also removed
because of their unclear licensing situation.
